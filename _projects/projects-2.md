# Safety Assessment on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles

This work provides a comparative study of the longitudinal safety performance of CAVs with different control design approaches, using microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, a novel data-driven nonmodel-based control design approach is presented for the CAVs in the mixed traffic flow. Based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), the learning-based control algorithm can be applied to learn suboptimal controllers from input-state data collected from the system solutions without the accurate prior knowledge of the system dynamics. In particular, human-driven vehicles and CAVs are generated from real traffic distribution of the New Jersey Turnpike highways. Both safety performance and the network efficiency are analyzed. The simulation results show that the ADP-based CAVs can improve the safety performance of the traffic network and simultaneously improve the transportation efficiency.
