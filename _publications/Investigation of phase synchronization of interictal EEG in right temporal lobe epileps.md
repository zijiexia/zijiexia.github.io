Highlights

* Power spectral and phase synchronization in the EEG activity of epileptics are investigated.

* The power of epileptics is increased in the whole brain compared with normal control.


* A higher degree of synchronization between distant channels is observed in the epileptics.

* The correlation between synchronization and power spectral becomes weaker for epileptics.
