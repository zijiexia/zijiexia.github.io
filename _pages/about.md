Currently I am working at Oracle as a Data Scientist. Before that, I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from New York University, where I was advised by Prof. [Zhongping Jiang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/zhong-ping-jiang). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Automation from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.
